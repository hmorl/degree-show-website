Ankita Anand is an Indian artist. Her background as an artist is in experimental moving image - where she combines documentary film and fiction to create surreal narratives. In the past year her focus has moved on to creative coding and programming, in particular exploring places where spirituality and technology might overlap. The medium (performance, installation or video) is chosen by the intention of the work, creating a clear link between the two. She wishes to make the boundaries between spirituality and technology more fluid by introducing eastern approaches like yogic philosophy into the debates regarding AI. Her projects attempt to link this ancient science back to contemporary and future technologies and how these approaches can be further developed to accommodate diversity and inclusiveness. 
 
Her work has been featured in the Creative Review and Saatchi Gallery Magazine after being shortlisted for the Love Art Young Artist Prize 2018. She has also been part of various international exhibitions and screenings including the London Short Film Festival (UK), Antwerp Art Weekend (Belgium), The Exchange Gallery (USA) and Espacio Pla (Argentina) to name a few.
 
Ankita was born in India and is currently based in London.
