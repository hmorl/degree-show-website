Rebecca Aston is a Zimbabwean artist currently based in London. Her work explores the material culture. She questions and decodes the meaning embedded in physical and virtual spaces, objects and the environment. Reflecting on post-colonialism, she examines global flows of data, matter and people, throughout history, up until the present day, to speculate on new futures. Temporality is central to her practice both as a subject matter and medium through which she explores history and memories by means of capture technologies, computation and the moving image. Rebecca has a BA in Fine Art from Yale. She also works as a web developer and creative technologist.
