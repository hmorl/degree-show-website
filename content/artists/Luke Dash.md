Luke Dash explores musical composition through software, their approach centered on the limitations of the minimal hardware which they take for a medium. Conceptually, the practice is motivated by a desire to interrogate notions of containment.
The calculated placement of components across this system is owed to a desire to gently upset ideas of outer limits. Length of string gives body to sounds discovered during a longstanding practice experimenting with electronic instruments. The implementation of these sounds uses as much of its single-board computer CPU capacity as possible. The design of these software synthesizers emerged in response to the unfamiliar resonant character of the materials making up the speakers. In turn, the compositions produced with the use of these instruments belong to the particular shape of this church.
Even when a system of limited parts operates under the rules of a closed design, the presence of those parts in full use prompts us to look outward. There is no superlative list of all things.
