Helena utilises science, technology and her cultural background as a way of investigating hidden mental spaces, speculative worlds and the politics of knowledge production. Her recent work has encompassed climate injustices, Chinese five element theory, geotechnology and speculative fiction, linking them through Yuk Hui's concept of a “moral cosmotechnics”. She examines new algorithmic paradigms and their effects on developmental, political and environmental realities through the lens of Qi, Dao and the I Ching. Recent concerns have included String Theory, Taoism, the evolution of Chinese predictive text, Malaysian politics and Shan Shui painting.

Her interest in the use of technology in activism informed her role as co-curator of the zine, publishing and activist festival DIY Cultures. She has exhibited her work in various places including The Courtauld Institute of Art, Studio 3 Gallery, Waterman's Arts Centre, QUAD in Derby, V&A, Tate Modern, Tate Britain, The Digital Fringe Festival (Melbourne), Copenhagen and Basal. Her video work is in the BFI National Archive. Co-curating and co-producing credits include projects for Secret Cinema, Future Cinema, Rich Mix (London) and Art Licks Weekend where she was nominated for the Workweek Prize for a project she undertook with POST Artists.
