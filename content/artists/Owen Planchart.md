Owen Planchart is a creative technologist using the border between the digital and the analogue as his medium. In the past, his work ranged from interactive video-mapping to 3d-printed sculptures and robotised found objects. His current projects explore the cross-contamination of art forms such as puppetry, performance and light sculpture which has been referred to as a kind of silicon-dadaism, using a unique style of multimedia collage to provoke layered readings on the subjects of transformation, synesthesia and control. His process involves using hi-tech components to extend the sensitivity and range of obsolete artefacts like gramophones and marionettes to create independent networks.
 
He has collaborated with performers in fields as divergent as sound-healing and burlesque shows and is fascinated by the power of the artistâ€™s presence in work that is otherwise confined to screens and headsets.
Almost entirely self-taught, he finds his inspiration at the intersection of art and technology and is constantly exploring ways to deliver a provocative response to the vapid, main-stream and spiritually bankrupt void found at the heart of our digital age.
 
Owen was born in Venezuela and is currently based in London.
