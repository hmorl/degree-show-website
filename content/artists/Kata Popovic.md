Katarina Popovic - Kata is a storyteller and media artist. Her works explore the process of reintegrating humans back (to their imminent) nature through art and technology. She examines how humans interface with non-humans revealing deep, often invisible connections. This year Kata is focused on the 'silent witnesses' concept – coined to describe the act of giving voice to natural elements and objects through electronics interventions and software. Kata is interested in how natural and cultural history can be experienced deeply, rather than just - seen or read about. Her latest interactive sonic piece  "Eerie" is highlighting the seemingly innocent act of touching’s potential to destroy. Ever inspired by mother nature, simplicity and intimacy in the works of Olafur Eliasson, Andy Goldsworthy and Wolfgang Laib, Kata’s works are revealing our interconnectedness across the biosphere aimed at awakening our _response-ability_ to the maladies brought by the Anthropocene. She is interested in our ability and activity that will create other versions of what currently looks like the 6th extinction. 
Since 2010, Kata has exhibited in Serbia, Slovenia, and the UK, and regularly exhibits with [http://www.nature-and-art.rs](http://www.nature-and-art.rs). Kata was born in Serbia, currently based between London, Belgrade and Istanbul and is open to artistic invitations around the world.
