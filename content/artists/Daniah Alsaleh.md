Daniah Alsalehâ€™s work tackles notions of the unobtrusive, the ordinary and the common. Her approach is to deconstruct and rearrange the obvious, to make the invisible visible, and manifest a space for reflection with new ways of seeing. She uses geometry and pattern making in her form of expression by mixing tangible and intangible objects of art, crossing disciplines from traditional mediums of painting to developing generative art processes with code.
