Eddie Wong is a creative technologist who works with Narration as a material. Coming from a background in animation, he understands the importance of bringing forth ordinary human stories that may otherwise be subsumed under the grand Narrations of history and power. Eddie intervenes in technologies to counteract the singular Narrations that have come to shape the data-hungry, post-truth world. He’s interested in presenting alternative viewpoints to the artificial intelligence hype by co-opting the same techniques used by techno-capitalism as an approach to dramatize the data. 

His artistic practice sees him experimenting with a combination of neural-network techniques to subvert the approaches and aesthetics that are generated by these models. In his latest piece 'the Unknown Person’, he connects Britain’s violent colonial legacy to a piece of family history. He draws a parallel between the control agents that have impacted his family’s survival in the past and the experience of living in an ultra-scrutinized information society today. 

Eddie has worked in the design and education sectors. Originally from Malaysia, he has lived in New Zealand and is currently based in London.
