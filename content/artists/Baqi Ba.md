Baqi Ba’s work explores the screen as a boundary between reality and data system. Her work often takes on a political approach as a critique of human-machine generated systems especially the ‘circular causal’ relationship between them. Her medium of practice includes photography, film, installations and computational media. Baqi’s current area of interest is on expanded forms of cinema, focusing on the use of interactivity and immersive narrative in a short film. Baqi was born in China (1994) and is currently based in London.
