Rachel is a designer and computational artist currently based in London. Her work utilizes digital and crafting platforms to create objects which question the non-transactional nature of technological interactions. Using humor and satire, her speculative and critical work delights, frustrates, and ultimately challenges assumptions and conceptions about the role that objects play in everyday life.
