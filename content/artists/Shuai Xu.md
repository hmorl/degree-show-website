Shuai Xu is a creative coder and new media artist currently based in London. Since 2016, Shuai has been focused on digital media art, technology, and science. His recent work bridged the conversation between traditional narrative language and algorithmic machine, exploring the relationship between immersive environment and interactive systems. In this way, the search for digital technology and narrative expression may be able to go beyond independent feeling, potentially creating new relationships between body, environment, and technology, as well as new ways to bring aesthetic consciousness among people. Shuai's main research includes digital performance, emergence of embodiment and immersive installation.
