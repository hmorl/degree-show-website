Panja’s artistic practice engages directly with the entangled human-machine relationships arising within the landscape of our current networked world. With a particular focus on experimental wearables and augmenting the body, she makes use of electronics, circuitry and custom interactive systems in order to create installations, wearable art and mixed reality experiences that aim to expose and often subvert their purpose.
 
Having worked for two decades in the design and tech industry, Panja is now using her previous knowledge to create speculative, thought-provoking pieces that aim to engage, disrupt and reconfigure our relationships with machines.
