Petros Velousis is an Athens-born, artist and creative technologist currently based in London. With a background in TV - theatre music composition, music production, and sound design, his work has been focusing on exploring new sonic possibilities and nontraditional approaches to musical practice.

His current art practices seek novel interpretations of sound and musical objects in responsive sound pieces and installations, aiming to question the way we interact with ourselves and with others, through our memories, as well as nature and the mechanical systems.  His creative process is inspired by the exploration of the surreal, the futile, chance and introspection.
