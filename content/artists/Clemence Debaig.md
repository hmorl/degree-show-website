Clemence Debaig is a designer, dancer and computational artist, based in London. She enjoys solving problems for people, working with digital technology and creating interactive experiences. With a background in mechanical engineering, industrial design, user experience and contemporary dance, she has worked on many high profile projects, while maintaining an active practice as an artist and dancer.

She is interested in exploring how interactivity can make people dance and how digital technology can encourage audience participation during performances. Her recent work focuses on exploring notions of control, harassment and apathy, questioning how human behaviours are changed when using the technology as a proxy to interact with each other.

In 2012, she founded l'Atelier du Lampadaire (The Streetlight Workshop), a multi-disciplinary artistic collective, based in France. It brought together dancers, actors, software engineers, architects and designers to create interactive performances at the intersection of those disciplines.
