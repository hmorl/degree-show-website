Edward Ward is an academic, artist and designer exploring speculative ecologies. His practice centres around the creation of physical artefacts that reflect current attitudes towards technology, ontologies, and the environment. Using a range of media and processes (organisms, programming, mechatronics). These works are realised to provoke discussion and inquiry within the field of post phenomenology and spatial practice.

His latest work explores the symbiotic relationship between algae, humans and technology; referencing the algae’s position in the systems of sensing, food politics and the Anthropocene. Drawing from artists and philosophers such as Bogost and Ihde, with perspectives of Object Oriented Ontology and Post Phenomenology, Marjan Colletti and Claudia Pasquero for their work on Post Digital and Bio-Architecture, and Lutz Koepnick’s reflections on slowness these ideas are enmeshed and embodied within the work.
What if? and Speculative Thinking are central themes to Edward’s work, encouraging the audience to think big and unrestrained, but with a grounding of feasibility and realisation. The practical working implementation of the work stands as central feature.

Edward Ward is living in Bournemouth, Dorset, UK.  He is currently leading a Computation Research group at the Arts University at Bournemouth and facilitates a MakerSpace in Bournemouth.
