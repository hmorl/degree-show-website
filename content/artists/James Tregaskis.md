James Tregaskis’ work is concerned with the increased lack of privacy borne out of living in a neoliberal world accelerated by ubiquitous digital technologies. He explores strategies for surviving within systems of surveillance and control, and presents his research expressed through modified domestic surveillance apparatus of the past.

James’s passion for computing started at age 11, after attending the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition at the ICA (1968). During his time working in advertising, he delivered his client the one of the world’s first colour portable computer in 1983 while working at Saatchi and Saatchi; then went on to continue his career in software development for the next 30 years. James was born in London where he is currently based.
