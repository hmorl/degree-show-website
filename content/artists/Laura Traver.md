Laura is a computational and fine artist based in London. Her work is founded in her interest in the exploration of the creative process and preference to discover an outcome, rather than design or imagine one. She frequently creates constructive systems and rules that probe and alter her role as the artist and facilitate the creation of art. Laura's work often bears evidence of her physical interaction and presence in the making of the piece, either through fast-paced, expressive gestures or controlled, focused mark-making.
 
  Laura has an MA in Fine Art from City & Guilds of London Art School and is also a Chartered Accountant working in business tax and this is reflected in the incorporation of logic in her creative process.
