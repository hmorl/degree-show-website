Eirini Kalaitzidi is a dance artist who works with technology in order to generate poetic movement and shape spaces where mutually affective encounters of bodies emerge. As an alternative to choreographing, she is exploring a techno-feminist practise of being in a choreo-milieu, i.e. in the in-between human and non-human, physical and digital, static and dynamic dancing agencies. Eirini is intrigued by blending and layering materials, dimensions and moving behaviours for the purpose of creating fictional choreo-related events. In her current practise, she employs Deep Learning among other computational means and participates in a computer-generated dance of 3-dimensional objects and 2-dimensional stick figures.
 
Eirini studied in National School of Dance (GR). She has presented her work ’Pistachios’ in Contemporary Theatre of Athens (2016) and ‘detail’ in Tinos island (2018). She has performed in various productions in Peiraios 260/Athens and Epidaurus Festival and Megaron/Athens Concert Hall among other stages of Athens and has collaborated with Patricia Apergi for the productions ‘Alcestis’ in Epidaurus Ancient Theatre (2017) and ‘Primary Fact’ in Onassis Cultural Centre (2018).
 
Eirini was born in Athens and is currently based in London.
