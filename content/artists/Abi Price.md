Abi Price is a computational artist and performer based in the UK. Her work includes installations, screen based generative art and the use of interactive technologies in performative settings. With a background in contemporary dance, she has created interdisciplinary performances, exploring the role of digital technologies within choreographic practice.

Her most recent interests involve the translation of screen based art into physical objects, as well as the use of computation to explore nature. This involves incorporating nature and it’s patterns into interactive interfaces, as well as the use of natural resources in the design and construction of her work.

Abi’s performance related work explores computer vision techniques as well as working with muscle signals to and how we can categorise movement from different signals. A recent work involved the use of wearables and audio, with the wearable creating a sound score from movement and touch made by the performer.
