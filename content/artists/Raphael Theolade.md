Raphael Theolade was born in France in 1987. He always has been fascinated by the individual and cultural perception of time and space and its synaesthetic manifestation through light, colour, movement and sound; as well as cultivating a vivid enthusiasm for late digital technologies. These interests were developed when he opted to take his 3D Animation Direction Degree in Supinfocom in Valenciennes (France) from 2007 to 2012.

After completing his degree, Raphael got involved in the animation industry, working for several projects such as features, series, music videos or commercials in various studios across Europe, including Cartoon Network and Passion Pictures.

Besides his everyday job he grew a passion for experimental music and visual arts that eventually led him to apply for the Computational Arts MA at Goldsmiths in 2018. His final project, "Taureau", is an ongoing VR opera project for concrete music situated at the intersection of his creative interests. Raphael has lived and worked in London since 2014.
