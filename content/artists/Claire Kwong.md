Claire Kwong makes interactive art to dramatize her personal experience with technology. She works with computation to create performances and interactive experiences.
Kwong creates generative systems and improvises within them. She incorporates live controls, spontaneous movement, and audience interaction. Her recent work at Goldsmiths draws on her studies of game design and participatory art.

Before moving to London to study at Goldsmiths, Kwong lived and worked in New York City. There, she exhibited work at local venues including Babycastles and Harvestworks. Since moving to Europe, she has shown work internationally at A MAZE in Berlin and JSNation in Amsterdam. 

Kwong also creates live visuals for electronic music shows, where she makes shapes, videos, and memes melt onto the screen. As a visualist, she has collaborated and performed with musicians from all over the world. Kwong aims to create visceral experiences, stage unusual encounters, and destabilize your sense of body. She also hopes to make you dance.
