Izzy McLellan is a computational artist with an academic background in Graphic Arts and Design. Her practice is increasingly guided by questions concerning what the terms craft and tradition encompass, in both an ancient and technological sense, and how fine the line is between nature and computation. On a material level these thoughts have guided a practice that heavily considers materiality and tools, the purpose of screens, and a crossover between ‘high’ and ‘low’ tech. The ethics that are beginning to take root within this practice involve an increasing awareness of the sustainability of the materials that form computational and traditional art, how the energy to run these pieces of computation is generated, and the transparency behind the process of the production of technology. 
 
Izzy is currently based in London.
