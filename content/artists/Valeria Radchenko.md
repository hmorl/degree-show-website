Valeria Radchenko is a multi-disciplinary artist whose work is, at its core, concerned with connection in the information age, and vibration as sound, as affect, as embodied states. Working mainly with video, performance and sound, they explore the micro/macro relationship between personal narratives and wider patterns and cycles of life. More generally - investigating what it means to be human by looking at our relationship with nature, technology, each other and our own selves. 

Radchenko explores how technology can be used in present-day practices of magic, specifically inducing trance states through digital sound that is centred and grounded by the voice. They are particularly interested in electronic musicâ€™s potential in making us feel strange, uncommon or even new feelings. Over the past year, they have been using computational processes to create their own tools for rituals and performances. 

Born in Russia, raised across London and Rotterdam, currently based in London.
