Taoran Xu (China, 1993) is active as a computational artist and sonic interactive designer. His works explore states wherein digital, analog signals and technology intertwine and merge into hybrid sonic units. The origins of his works follow a line of research into field recordings and soundwalks, soundscape ecology and the immersive potential of spatial sound and sensorial potential of technology. His installation works immerse the audience and construct new realities, manifesting through multi-channel projection and dynamic binaural experiences. His current focus is on 'soundscape sculpturing' which is based on creating bespoke sonic interfaces, softwares and sonic interaction design.
