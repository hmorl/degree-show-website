Sarah Song is a new media artist currently based in London. Her practice lies at the junction of the natural world, sound, as well as visuals. She works in a variety of media and most of her artworks aim to explore the creative relationships and possibilities between nature and digital technology and to find poetic meaning in one's daily life. Always fascinated by the macroscopic world, the concepts of minimalism and surrealism. She believes mystery reveals itself through nature and time which we often overlooked. She loves to experiment with patterns, texture and mixed media so that her vivid imagination can be captured and realised. Sarah hopes to provide her audience with an unprecedented personal experience through her recent research on Iridology and biometric data sonification.
