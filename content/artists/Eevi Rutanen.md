In the work of Eevi Rutanen (b.1992, Finland), interactive installations, sculpture, and software merge into uncanny hybrids of bodies and technology. Drawing on her background in bioengineering, Eevi's work is often inspired by biological processes and forms. By combining computational systems and scientific paradigms with frivolity and feminist theory, she strives to imagine alternative ways of being and knowing through empowered softness and sensuality. Eevi graduated with a BA in Graphic Design from Aalto University in 2016, and is currently finishing her MFA degree in Computational Arts. Eevi has participated in multiple group shows in London and internationally, and her first solo show _Uncanny Dimple_ opened in July in Helsinki.
