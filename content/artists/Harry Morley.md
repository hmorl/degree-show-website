Harry Morley is a musician and computational artist with a background in jazz, popular music and sound design. His love of deep listening together with improvising, has led him to focus on using noise, silence, harmony and recorded sounds in his work.

Harry creates generative, ongoing systems as well as designing new ways to organise and visualise sounds using machine learning. He also explores the lives of inanimate objects and thinks about musical objects as creatures to influence and be influenced by.

Harry graduated from the University of Surrey with a BMus in Creative Music Technology (2017), where he won the Ableton Prize for best computer-based live performance. As well as music and code, Harry loves cooking, drinking tea and also his pet gerbil, Lion. He was born in Maidstone, England (1996) and is currently based in London.
