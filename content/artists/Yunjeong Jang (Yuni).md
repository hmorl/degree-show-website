Yunjeong Jang (Yuni) was born in Busan (1993), developed her career in Seoul and is currently based in London. From childhood, she was surrounded by novel technologies and engineering practices. This has left a strong impact on the aesthetic development of her art practice. In digital art, she praises the utopian harmony between organic and machinery. Furthermore, Yuni provides an approach that examines how binary matters can be combined, such as living with non-living, organic and inorganic, human and non-human with the development of technology and science. Yuni has intentions to highlight what is positive in technology. As an independent artistic mind, she is questioning herself about the possibility of synthetical mechanism combined with organic parts. At the moment she is exploring novel interdisciplinary studies in search of a perfect symbiosis of organics and new technologies as well as experimenting with the technical and scientific possibilities in the new media art field.
