John Dore explores the relationship between the pursuit of knowledge and aesthetic gratification. Utilising methods and approaches rooted in computer science, biology, mathematics and philosophy. Johnâ€™s work pivots on traversing unfamiliar territories for the sake of temporary illumination. At the core of his practice is the notion that if the purpose of visualization is insight, then perhaps it is through space, both afforded to and created by fleeting aesthetics, that our definitions of insight and understanding can be re-imagined.
