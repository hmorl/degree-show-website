Julien Mercierâ€™s core topics of interest are ethics and accountability in Machine Learning, and cognitive processes such as self-perception and cognitive dissonance. His work ranges across installation, sound, and video, as following both material and conceptual concerns. 

He assumes moving images as being replicas of reality, and as such finds it vital to understand them as fluid artefacts that promote immersive experiences. Recent advances in Deep Learning afford more dimensions than ever before: Julien explores the mystifying capacities of such technology. His work takes the form of simulacral spaces where concepts of power, possession, truth, original and copy are shown to be obsolete. His artistic research de-situates notions like human vs non-human intelligence, nature vs culture, expression vs frustration, or authority vs autonomy. Through sounds and images, he seeks to create a grammar to extend the thoughts that words constrain. In a time where growth, domination, power, and strength monopolize our lexicons, he sees art as the last of possibles: a space to disobey, think disruptively, and in unresolved ways. 

Julien is a multimedia artist and graphic designer from Switzerland, currently living in London. He collaborates with various cultural institutions involved in design and art research. Contact by telepathy only.
