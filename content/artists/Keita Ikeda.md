Keita Ikeda is a creative technologist working with light, physical materials and computer programming to explore visual perception, form and materiality. He seeks to design alternative mediums of artistic expression, and finds beauty not only in the content of a work, but in the very process of information materialising through a medium. He sees computation as a fundamental element in his practice, not merely as a tool but a material in its own right, like paint for a painter.
