Nathan Bayliss interrogates technology that shapes the human experience. He asks how we may better understand the technologies that invisibly reconfigure contemporary life and how these technologies could be re-purposed to tell down to earth, personal stories. Working within a deconstructed documentary format, his recent films utilise machine learning to build models from the past to speculate on (im)possible futures. Born in Australia, Nathan Bayliss moved to London in 2008 and now works from a studio in Hackney, East London. He founded motion design and VR studio Lightfield in 2016 and works with clients across advertising, corporate, fashion and charity sectors.
