Teodora Sinziana Fartan is an artist, writer and creative technologist based in London, UK. Her art practice investigates new modes of experience and methods for generating alternate imaginaries through the use of speculation, fictioning and deconstructed narratives as thought-making tools for imagining beyond our current accelerationist climate and its progressively apparent flaws. With a focus on fiction production as critical practice, Teodoraâ€™s work often draws on science fiction, natural phenomena, literary techniques, mythology, ritual practices, cosmological perspectives and futurology in its attempt to seek what can exist beyond our increasingly computationally-driven social, political, environmental and existential context. Hallucinating alternate imaginaries together with software agents and envisioning the objects that may reference these para-spaces through speculative exploration occupy a central position in her art-making process, alongside circuit bending, exploratory writing, tinkering with electronics, designing interactive systems and building custom software to make these come to life. Her previous work has been featured in exhibitions across Romania, Hungary, the UK and Australia. Most recently, she has spoken about her perspective on art-making as a multi-faceted practice of fiction production and creating speculative tools for artistic practice at transmediale 2019, Deptford Enclave, Hertfordshire University, RIXC Festival and the Digital Ecologies II Symposium.
