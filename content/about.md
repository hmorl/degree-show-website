The MA/MFA Computational Arts final exhibition *So, how is that working for you?* aims to interrogate the relational tensions playing out within the newly-formed spaces of artistic and technological collaboration. Reflecting on critical provocations of what it means to create computationally, particularly in the current state of technological augmentations permeating the deeper substrates of our human existence, we ask the open-ended question: *So, how is that working for you?* in order to probe the potentiality of dislodging computation from its status as an instrument of increasingly coercive control and repurposing it within artistic discourses that aim to open up new avenues for alternative technological narratives.

The exhibition is structured around seven thematic clusters arising from this process of exploring new pathways for artistic computation, gathered under the key term *threads*. Evoking the idea of multiple units of execution implemented simultaneously within a computational process, these threads encompass a way of interpreting the plenitude of computationally-driven practices that find themselves engaged with each other by either coming together through a process of weaving or pulling apart in a process of unravelling. Threads are thus approached as both symbolic of the diversity of approaches and practices running concomitantly within the larger executable machine of computational arts, and illustrative of the potential convergence and divergence of such practices as they run their course through exploring alternative implementations of technology. Seven prominent threads have been selected as conceptual spaces where multiple approaches to computation can inform and interrogate each other: <span class = 'intelligence'>intelligence</span>, <span class = 'phenomenon'>phenomenon</span>, <span class = 'narration'>narration</span>, <span class = 'network'>network</span>, <span class = 'matter'>matter</span>, <span class = 'embodiment'>embodiment</span> and <span class = 'surveillance'>surveillance</span>.

*So, how is that working for you?* is a set of speculative responses to these themes, questions and tensions; providing a placeholder for what *that* may be and leaving open and inconclusive what may be considered as *working*, the exhibition invites the audience to explore potential answers to this question alongside the artists, through engaging with the works and delving into the overlaps, discrepancies and dialogues arising between them.

THREADS:

<ul id = "about-thread-grid">
<li><span class = 'intelligence'>INTELLIGENCE:</span>
Attributing human conceptions of intelligence to technology can take many forms; whether it is through machine learning, artificial intelligence, human-machine interaction or less complex forms of intelligence like natural language processing and computer vision.<br><br></li>

<li><span class = 'phenomenon'>PHENOMENON:</span>
These works include an experiential element in the context of relating to and understanding the world, providing a more macro view of relations. This includes themes of mysticism and rituals, world events and planetary epochs.<br><br></li>

<li><span class = 'narration'>NARRATION:</span>
Story telling can be an act of recording past times and places, or a means for the fabulation of new and alternative realities. Narratives can also emerge from research practices, and new modes of narration can be explored through interrogating the traditions and conventions of story telling.<br><br></li>

<li><span class = 'network'>NETWORK:</span>
These works focus on forms of connection, both natural and artificial; from planetary systems, to ecological root networks to urban transportation networks and maps.<br><br></li>

<li><span class = 'matter'>MATTER:</span>
These works move the focus away from the human and centre around the agency of other beings, objects and materials. These works draw from theories within Object Oriented Ontology/Feminism and have elements of robotics or organic materials.<br><br></li>

<li><span class = 'embodiment'>EMBODIMENT:</span>
The body here is addressed through several dimensions, be it biological, physical, virtual or spiritual. Embodiment as a practice can also give form to intangible things and tackle notions of representation.<br><br></li>

<li><span class = 'surveillance'>SURVEILLANCE:</span>
As well as addressing ubiquitous and watchful technologies, this thread also includes working with data gathering, noise and notions of measuring and tracking the world.  <br><br></li>
